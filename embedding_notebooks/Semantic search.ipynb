    "Although we could look at methods to embed each article so as to create one dense vector per article, we need to consider the limitations of such an approach. Embedding models have a token limit but also embedding large texts results in a loss of granularity as the local information or specific details of the text may be averaged out or overshadowed by the dominant themes of the text.\n",

A naive approach might inadvertently slice a sentence in half, causing a loss of vital context. Imagine having a sentence where the first part poses a question and the second part delivers an answer. If these two segments were separated, the overall understanding of that information would be compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our embedding process, we employ a strategy that aims to preserve context. We divide each article into segments containing 256 tokens. To achieve this, we implement a sliding window mechanism. The window spans 256 tokens of the text, and for each step, it moves by 192 tokens. This means that consecutive chunks will overlap by 64 tokens, ensuring that adjacent text segments share roughly one-quater of their content.\n",
